Netflix Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Netflix dataset to uncover insights into the content available on the platform. The analysis includes data cleaning, handling missing values, conducting basic statistical analysis, and visualizing key patterns in the dataset using Python.
Project Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in understanding the structure and patterns within a dataset. This project utilizes a Netflix dataset to perform EDA, revealing insights into the distribution of content by genre, release year, ratings, and other factors. The primary goal is to clean the data, analyze it, and visualize the findings to better understand the content landscape on Netflix.

Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis contains information about movies and TV shows available on Netflix. Key features include:

Title: Name of the movie or TV show.
Genre: The genre of the content.
Release Year: The year the content was released.
Rating: Viewer rating of the content.
Duration: Duration in minutes for movies, and seasons for TV shows.
Country: Country of production.
The dataset is available in the data/ directory and serves as the foundation for the analysis.

Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary Python packages. You can install all dependencies using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Required Dependencies
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
Numpy: For numerical operations.
Matplotlib: For creating static and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
Jupyter: For running and sharing the Jupyter Notebook.
Usage
To run the analysis and explore the data:


Duplicate Removal: Identifying and removing duplicate entries.
Handling Missing Values: Filling or removing missing data to maintain consistency.
Data Type Conversion: Ensuring all data types are correct for analysis.
This step ensures that the dataset is prepared for accurate analysis.

Statistical Analysis
The project performs various statistical analyses to understand the dataset better:

Summary Statistics: Calculation of mean, median, mode, etc., to summarize the data.
Data Distributions: Analysis of how data is distributed across different categories, such as genres and release years.
Correlations: Exploration of relationships between numerical features using correlation matrices.
These analyses provide a foundational understanding of the data.

Data Visualization
Visualization plays a key role in EDA. The project uses the following visual tools:

Distribution Plots: To explore the distribution of content by genre, year, rating, etc.
Correlation Heatmaps: To visualize the relationship between different numerical features.
Bar Charts and Histograms: To identify trends and patterns over time.
These visualizations help in interpreting the data more effectively.
